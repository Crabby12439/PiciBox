  <h1>Pici Box</h1>
  <p>🚀</p>
  <p>PiciBox is a fun, interactive, web based game to play with friends! It features a fully intergrated party pack sharing store built in to the platform so you can save and play your packs any time, any place. This project was heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.jackboxgames.com/">JackBox Games</a> and was somewhat of a passion project. I hope you enjoy! 💙</p>

# How to play 🕹️

- 👩 Each player receives a prompt that they must respond to
- 📈 This will continue for each round
- 🕶️ After you're done responding, you'll be able to review each prompt and response and vote for the person you think wrote that response
- 🏆 Each correctly voting player will receive +500 points. The player with the most points by the end wins.

**PiciBox can be played with parties of up to 100 people. A spectator mode is something I'm working on and should be ready soon!**

# Creating packs 📦

PiciBox has a built in pack system for creating and saving your own prompts. You can check it out and create your own pack [here](https://picipici.games/store). It's reccomended that each prompt in a pack follow the following guidelines.

- ❓ Try to include **how would you/what would you**
- 👀 Be specific
- 😆 Use inside jokes

**Keep in mind, all packs are public and are auto-deleted after 90 days of no use. Don't include any personal details or things you would'nt tell to strangers!**
