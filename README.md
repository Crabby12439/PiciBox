  <h1>Pici Box</h1>
  <p>🚀</p>
  <p>PiciBox is a fun, interactive, web based game to play with friends! It features a fully intergrated party pack sharing store built in to the platform so you can save and play your packs any time, any place. This project was heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.jackboxgames.com/">JackBox Games</a> and was somewhat of a passion project. I hope you enjoy! 💙</p>
